# FRCScout2017

[STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

# Overview

This app has been built by the RoboTigers (Team 1796) for FIRST FRC Scouting for the 2017 Steamworks season. It provides screens for collecting Pit and Match data as well as Summary and Analytics screens. It is best used on an iPad. Data is stored locally in the iPad as well as in the iCloud account of the iPad user. Data sychronization between multiple iPads is provided via iCloud. The typical use case is for a scouting team to have one iPad per scout with each iPad logged in to the same team iCloud account. Synchronization is automatic. Data export is also provided via email csv files.

From each analytics report table and from the Team Page you may select a team and look at the data just for that team. This include Pit Report data, Team Summary Data, and a list of matches played by that team.


# Analytics

The app can provide analytics on the pit and match data. You can quickly get a list of the best teams sorted by skill or by match results.
