# FRCScout2017

[STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

# Overview

This app has been built by the RoboTigers (Team 1796) for FIRST FRC Scouting for the 2017 Steamworks season. It provides screens for collecting Pit and Match data as well as Summary and Analytics screens. It is best used on an iPad. Data is stored locally in the iPad as well as in the iCloud account of the iPad user. Data sychronization between multiple iPads is provided via iCloud. The typical use case is for a scouting team to have one iPad per scout with each iPad logged in to the same team iCloud account. Synchronization is automatic. Data export is also provided via email csv files.
